# Flash Card App ⚡
`Python 3.11.1`

This is a flash card game to learn new words in other languages, this game currently has 2 types of languages:

- French to English
- English to Spanish

For now, if you want to change the language, change the `french_words.csv` file to `english_words.csv`.

## How it works
The words will be displayed randomly and after 3 seconds the word will be displayed in the second language, for example if the word is in French, after the mentioned time the word will be displayed in English

At the bottom you have 2 buttons, one with a cross `❌` and one with a check mark `✅`:

- Press the `✅` check mark for the words you already know
- Press the `❌` check mark for words you do not know

At the end a new CSV file will be generated with the words you do not know, which will be the ones selected for learning.
