# Flash Card App ⚡
`Python 3.11.1`

This is a flash card game to learn new words in other languages, this game currently has 2 types of languages:

- French to English
- English to Spanish

For now, if you want to change the language, change the `french_words.csv` file to `english_words.csv`.

## How it works
The words will be displayed randomly, at the bottom you have 2 buttons, one with a cross `❌` and one with a check mark `✅`:

- Press the `✅` check mark for the words you already know.
- Press the `❌` check mark for words you do not know.

At the end a new CSV file will be generated with the words you do not know, which will be the ones selected for learning.
